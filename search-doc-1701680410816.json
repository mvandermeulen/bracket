So why does Bracket exist?  Firstly, there are no complete open-source tournament systems to be found on github. Let me know if you find one, I will list it here as alternative to Bracket. Furthermore, the closed-source tournament systems that can be found online are typically payware, and quite expensive.  Secondly, there is a lack of tournament systems that support Swiss tournaments. There are a few that exist, but they're typically quite ancient projects. Furthermore, AFAIK the Swiss tournament systems that exist usually only support Swiss, no other types of tournament elements (round-robin, elimination etc.). That is quite a limitation when you want to host a tournament that starts with Swiss and determines a winner based on a knockoff (elimination) stage.  Finally, I developed this project to learn more about Next.js and apply my Python (e.g. FastAPI) experience to a project with a real purpose.
